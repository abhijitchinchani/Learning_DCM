# Learning DCM with SPM

This repository contains example implementations of Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) using **SPM** (Statistical Parametric Mapping). It serves as a personal learning project to understand and apply different types of DCM analyses to fMRI data.

## Contents

I implemented/ tested five key DCM examples:

1. **DCM for fMRI – 1st Level (Attention)**
2. **DCM for fMRI – 2nd Level (Motor)**
3. **DCM for fMRI – 1st Level (Language)**
4. **DCM for fMRI – 2nd Level (Language)**
5. **Spectral DCM – Resting-State fMRI**
